No information provided to the App is transmitted to me or anyone else.
The App does not collect information for purposes of our collection. Your

Background Location

This application does collect location information (specifically Wi-Fi ssid name) in the background
for the auto tunnel feature. This information is not stored or transmitted but is simple collected 
by the app to determine whether or not to turn on the VPN.
